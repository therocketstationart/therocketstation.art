My name is Lucia, and I am a Peruvian artist, currently living in New Zealand.

I come from a beautiful city called Cusco. When I was a child I searched for
many ways to entertain myself, and thanks to the intervention of several people
I was guided to the world of art. Since then, I have never stopped creating and
exploring ideas. I specialize in works with a lot of detail, black acrylic
paint, and black ink fineliner pens.

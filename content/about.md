title = 'About Me'
+++

My name is Lucia, and I am a Peruvian artist, currently settling in to my new
life in Nelson, New Zealand.

I come from a beautiful city called Cusco in the Peruvian Andes. As a child I
sought many ways to entertain myself, and thanks to the guidance of several
people I was introduced to the world of art. Once I discovered this part of
myself, I never stopped creating or exploring ideas. I enjoy working on pieces
with a lot of fine detail, becoming absorbed in the process, an escape from the
trials and stresses of daily life.

The inspiration behind each work is the therapy that art gives me. Being an
immigrant I often find myself alone with my thoughts and my art helps me to find
peace and security in myself so I can connect with people and this new
environment.

I hope you find something that speaks to you in my art and thank you for yor
support.

I am a Peruvian artist, currently living in New Zealand.

I have been called a 'dreamer' from an early age, because my mind could not stay
grounded; always making noise, asking questions, as I translated my thoughts and
ideas into endless doodles. I could never switch off my chaotic head and I
always sought out some way to express what was inside it. Over many years I have
navigated through a sea of ​​techniques and styles until finally settling on one
that truly expressed my identity.

Art is the most personal means I have to express myself. When I draw the stars,
planets, and rockets, it is my way to welcome you into  the world of this
'dreamer'.
